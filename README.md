# R_Analysis
Challenge 14

### GOAL: The Goal of the challenge is to learn about R and stadistics. We are going to read two CSV and analyze the data with them. R has a lot of libraries and functions that are going to simplify our work. The functions ask us for inputs and then we are going to have different outputs. The important part is that we do not need to worry about the math. 


## Delivery 1
### We first read the csv and convert the data into a data frame. The R built in functions and libraries are going to perform a lineal regression for us. Please see the summary output from R.

### Again, the output is really useful for stadistical purposes. It does a lot of the math for us. 

## Delivery 2
### We are going to read another CSV and thn the data will be converted into a dataframe. Again, we are using another of the R tools to do stadistical work for us. In this case, we are going to use the "summary" one.
