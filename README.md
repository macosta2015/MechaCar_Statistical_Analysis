# R_Analysis
Challenge 14

### GOAL: The Goal of the challenge is to learn about R and stadistics. We are going to read two CSV and analyze the data with them. R has a lot of libraries and functions that are going to simplify our work. The functions ask us for inputs and then we are going to have different outputs. The important part is that we do not need to worry about the math.
